You are free to use this code in any project you see fit, even though it would be nice to know about it ( out of curiosity :) ).
This is a Arduino library for the 4511 IC (BCD to 7 Segments Display).

# INSTALL
Just drop the files on your arduino library folder, so the structure stays like this:
- libraries
  - BCDTo7Seg
    - BCDTo7Seg.cpp
	- BCDTo7Seg.h
	- keywords.txt
	- examples/
	  - b4511_counter
	    - b4511_counter.pde
		
Thanks!
